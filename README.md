# Encrypt-Decrypt-Asset
My Encryption and decryption tool

It can be used to encrypt any text file or UTF-8 based text file using some basic encryption algorithm designed and written by me. And to decrypt the encrypted file with the provided decryption tool. Feel free to use the exe file or edit the program and pull a request. 

This is a full working version of the project with all the bugs fixed.

Note: While running the executable file make shre to have the icon file in the same location ad the executable file or else the program window and taskbar would not show its icon. I still need to fix this issue so please feel free to pull a request to hepl me out with this.
